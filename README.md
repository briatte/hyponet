R code to plot the citation network of [Hypothèses](http://hypotheses.org/) blogs. See [this blog post](http://politbistro.hypotheses.org/2737) (in French).

The `data` folder contains the [list of all Hypothèses blogs](master/data/blogs.csv) ([source](http://www.openedition.org/catalogue-notebooks)) as of June 2015, and an [example corpus](master/data/corpus.csv) assembled from that seed list. Running the scripts will download a different sample of blog posts, leading to a different corpus.
